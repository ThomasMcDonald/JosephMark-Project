## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone this repo

Install all required dependencies
```
npm install
```
Navigate to the root directory and start VUEjs 
```
npm run dev
```
These steps are for dev purposes only.

## Deployment

Deploy as you wish, I honestly have no idea what to do here
```
npm run build
```
This app isnt served from a server so once you have run the command you will find all contents in the dist folder


## Built With

- [expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - The server for handling and routing HTTP requests
- [VUEjs](https://vuejs.org/) - The Front end framework
- [LocalForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage) - Local Storage handler
